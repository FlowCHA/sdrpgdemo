# sdrpgdemo

sdrpgdemo is a demo file to provide simple Unity tutorials to the Software Development class.

v0.0.1- two unity scenes, with a linking door between them. 
the player currently spawns in the center of each room, with no memory of the previous room, or changes to the scenes. 
the second room (top) has a "secret" door, which the player can walk through.

v0.0.2 - 
sprites updated: player sprite, background. 
objects added: soccerBall object to kick around(shares sprite with Player because it was recycled as an example). Just an interactable item example.
scripts added: soccerBall script. Item class to inherit items from.
other changes: replaced zip file with updated version.
