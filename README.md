# sdrpgdemo

sdrpgdemo is a demo file to provide simple Unity tutorials to the Software Development class.
v0.0.1- two unity scenes, with a linking door between them. the player currently spawns in the center of each room, with no memory of the previous room, or changes to the scenes. the second room (top) has a "secret" door, which the player can walk through.
